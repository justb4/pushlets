			<para>
				In theory Pushlets should work in all modern browsers.
				However there may be incompatibilities, plus I don't have the resources to test all combinations
				of browsers/(minor)versions/platforms. I will keep a list here for what I've found thus far.
				<link href="mailto:just AT justobjects.nl">Let me know</link>
				if something did (not) work on your browser.
				To help me in filling this table try the
				<link href="/pushlet/examples/ping/ping.html" target="_new">Pushlet Ping</link>
				to see if it works in your browser.

				Note: Netscape
				was reported to work on many other Unixes (HP, Irix etc) besides Linux.
				Besides the table below I also generate a

			<para>
				Pushlet development was initially done with the Jetty servlet server. In theory Pushlets should
				work with all Java2 servlet-based servers but this remains theory as long as it has not been tested.
				For servlet engines that support J2EE .war files and webapp v2.3 it is just a matter
				of dropping pushlet.war into the webapps autodeploy directory.

			<para>
				Pushlets are known to workon at least the following servers.

					<cell>Tried with Apache 1.3.12. Either Apache or JServ seem to buffer the Pushlet events. They come

						If adding spaces to the events (to let the buffers fill up) events are pushed more quickly, but
						clearly
						this is not the way to go. Any ideas ? (Chunked Encoding?).

						Only gotcha is that you need to set &lt;ignore-client-disconnect&gt;false&lt;/ignore-client-disconnect&gt;
						within
						the &lt;http-server&gt; section of resin.conf. Otherwise resources are held since the
						IOException is never

						<para>
							<italic>"I have your demos running on WebSphere 3.02 ok. I need to make modifications so
								that yours jsps etc work on JSP 0.91 and some urls needed to be changed to run
								on a websphere server.

								But, this does seem to be a problem with garbage collection subscriptions. It
								appears that once the browser closes, the socket is not being closed. Hence,
								when your stuff calls flush on the socket, IOException is not being thrown and
								the subscription doesn't ever goe away. I've had them hanging around for around
								an hour now with no browser. I'm using the IBM JDK 1.1.8 on NT to run WebSphere
								(NT SP3)."
