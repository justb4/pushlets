# Pushlets
Pushlets are a server-side web-push technology based on pure HTML/JavaScript (then called Dynamic HTML, DHTML) on the front-end and
a dedicated Java-Servlet webapp (`.war`) in the backend. Basically it is a publish-subscribe framework.
 
I developed this around 1999, yes did lots of Java then.

Read more on http://pushlets.com. The demos should still work after 20 years...

See also the [2000-article on JavaWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2076063/pushlets--send-events-from-servlets-to-dhtml-client-browsers.html) (now InfoWorld)

There is also mention on [Pushlets on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Pushlet) on as one of the first pre-AJAX/COMET server push technologies.

Somehow this project meant a lot to me and my further career.
Hence saving it here.

This project has been migrated from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pushlets/).

## Plans

No further development, but Dockerizing and maintaining it in the cloud.

Off course you are free to further contribute to the project.
